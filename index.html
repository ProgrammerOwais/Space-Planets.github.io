                        Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and 
                        events have relative position and direction. <strong>In simple words ..</strong>
                        Space, also known as outer space, is the near-vacuum between celestial bodies. 
                        It is where everything (all of the planets, stars, galaxies and other objects) 
                        is found. On Earth, space begins at the Kármán line (<strong>100 km above sea level</strong>). 
                        This is where Earth's atmosphere is said to stop and outer space begins.

                    <p class="para1">
                        Humans have always looked up into the night sky and dreamed about space.
                        In the latter half of the 20th century, rockets were developed that were 
                        powerful enough to overcome the force of gravity to reach orbital velocities, 
                        paving the way for space exploration to become a reality.
                        On <span class="bold underline">Oct. 4, 1957</span> , the Soviets launched the first artificial satellite, 
                        Sputnik 1, into space. Four years later on April 12, 1961, Russian Lt. 
                        Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit Earth in Vostok 1.
                        The first U.S. satellite, <span class="bold underline">Explorer 1</span> , went into orbit on Jan. 31, 1958. 
                        In 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to fly into space.
                        The International Space Station is a research laboratory in low Earth 
                        orbit. With many different partners contributing to its design and 
                        construction, this high-flying laboratory has become a symbol of 
                        cooperation in space exploration, with former competitors now working 
                        together.

                        On April 12, 1961, aboard the spacecraft Vostok 1, Soviet cosmonaut 
                    Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin becomes the first human being to travel 
                    into space. During the flight, the 27-year-old test pilot and industrial 
                    technician also became the first man to orbit the planet, a feat 
                    accomplished by his space capsule in 89 minutes. Vostok 1 orbited Earth 
                    at a maximum altitude of 187 miles and was guided entirely by an automatic 
                    control system. The only statement attributed to Gagarin during his one hour 
                    and 48 minutes in space was, “Flight is proceeding normally; I am well.”
                    The triumph of the Soviet space program in putting the first man into space 
                    was a great blow to the United States, which had scheduled its first space 
                    flight for May 1961.

                        There’s a planet made of diamonds twice the size of earth 
                        The "super earth," aka 55 Cancri e, is most likely covered 
                        in graphite and diamond

                    <div class="para1 pl-1 text-info lead">
                        There are about three trillion trees on Planet Earth, and 
                        between 100-400 billion stars, approximately, in the galaxy.

                        The universe extends far beyond our own galaxy, The Milky Way, which is why scientists 
                        can only estimate how many stars are in space.  However, scientists estimate the universe 
                        contains approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a septillion.   While 
                        no one can actually count every single grain of sand on the earth, the estimated total 
                        from researchers at the University of Hawaii, is somewhere around seven quintillion, 
                        five hundred quadrillion grains.  That is an awfully big sand castle!.
