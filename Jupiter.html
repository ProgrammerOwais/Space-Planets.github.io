                        <span class="h4 bold underline orange-yellow">Jupiter</span> is the fifth planet from the Sun and the 
                        largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half 
                        times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less 
                        than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span> is the third-brightest natural object 
                        in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic 
                        <img src="images/pl6.jpg" alt="images" class="image-fluid float-right jupiterimg1">
                        times and is named after the Roman god <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span>, the king of the gods, because of its 
                        observed size.<span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span> is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium comprises one quarter 
                        of its mass and one tenth of its volume. It likely has a rocky core of heavier elements,[17] 
                        but like the other giant planets, <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span> lacks a well-defined solid surface. The on-going 
                        contraction of its interior generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun.
                        Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid; it has a 
                        slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated 
                        into several bands at different latitudes, with turbulence and storms along their interacting 
                        boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have
                         existed since at least the 17th century, when it was first seen by telescope.

                        Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span>, making its closest 
                        approach to the planet in December 1973.[19] <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span> has since been explored 
                        on a number of occasions by robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer 
                        and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo orbiter, 
                        which arrived at <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span> in 1995.

                    <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span> is the only planet whose barycentre with the Sun lies outside the volume of 
                    the Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius.[106] The average distance between 
                    <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span> and the Sun is 778 million km (about 5.2 times the average distance between 
                    Earth and the Sun, or 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86 years. This is 
                    approximately two-fifths the orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance.
                    The orbital plane of <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span> is inclined 1.31° compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity 
                    of its orbit is 0.048, <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span> is slightly over 75 million km nearer the Sun at perihelion 
                    than aphelion.[

                    <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span>'s rotation is the fastest of all the Solar System's planets, completing a 
                    rotation on its axis in slightly less than ten hours; this creates an equatorial 
                    bulge easily seen through an amateur telescope. The planet is an oblate spheroid, 
                    meaning that the diameter across its equator is longer than the diameter measured 
                    between its poles. On <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span>, the equatorial diameter is 9,275 km (5,763 mi) longer 
                    than the polar diameter

                <div class="para1 pl-1">
                    Because <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span> is not a solid body, its upper atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. 
                    The rotation of <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span>'s polar atmosphere is about 5 minutes longer than that of the 
                    equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when 
                    graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies to latitudes from 10° N to 10° S; 
                    its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north 
                    and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was defined by radio astronomers and 
                    corresponds to the rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is <span class="orange-yellow">Jupiter</span>'s official 
                    rotation
