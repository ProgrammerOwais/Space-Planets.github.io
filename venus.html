                        <span class="venus-color bold">Venus</span> is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of 
                        love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the 
                        Moon, <span class="venus-color">Venus</span> can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked 
                        eye in broad daylight.[17][18] <span class="venus-color">Venus</span> lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears 
                        to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in 
                        the east a little while before dawn. <span class="venus-color">Venus</span> orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. With a 
                        sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days and a synodic day length of 117 Earth days, it 
                        takes significantly longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System,

                        and does so in the opposite direction to all but <span class="uranus">Uranus</span> (meaning the Sun rises in the west and 
                        sets in the east).[20] <span class="venus-color">Venus</span> does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury 
                        among the planets in the Solar System.

                        because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. 
                        It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere 
                        of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric 
                        pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly 
                        the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, 
                        <span class="venus-color">Venus</span> has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 
                        737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). <span class="venus-color">Venus</span> is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of 
                        sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have 
                        had water oceans in the past,[22][23] but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due 
                        to a runaway greenhouse effect.[24] The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen 
                        has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic 
                        field.

                        orbit every 224.7 days. Although all planetary 
                         orbits are elliptical, <span class="venus-color">Venus</span>' orbit is currently the closest to circular, with 
                         an eccentricity of less than 0.01.[5] Simulations of the early solar system orbital 
                         dynamics have shown that the eccentricity of the <span class="venus-color">Venus</span> orbit may have been substantially 
                         larger in the past, reaching values as high as 0.31 and possibly impacting the early 
                         climate evolution.[116] The current near-circular orbit of <span class="venus-color">Venus</span> means that when <span class="venus-color">Venus</span> 
                         lies between Earth and the Sun in inferior conjunction, it makes the closest approach to

                         reaches inferior conjunction every 584 days, on average.[5] Because of the decreasing 
                         eccentricity of Earth's orbit, the minimum distances will become greater over tens of 
                         thousands of years. From the year 1 to 5383, there are 526 approaches less than 40 million 
                         km; then there are none for about 60,158 years.

                        once every 243 Earth days—the slowest rotation of any planet. Because its rotation 
                        is so slow, <span class="venus-color">Venus</span> is very close to spherical.[119] A <span class="venus-color">Venus</span>ian sidereal day thus lasts 
                        longer than a <span class="venus-color">Venusian</span> year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). <span class="venus-color">Venus</span>' equator rotates at
                        6.52 km/h (4.05 mph), whereas Earth's rotates at 1,674.4 km/h (1,040.4 mph).[123][124] 
                        <span class="venus-color">Venus</span>' rotation period measured with Magellan spacecraft data over a 500-day period is 
                        smaller than the rotation period measured during the 16-year period between the Magellan

                        [125] Because 
                        of the retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter 
                        than the sidereal day, at 116.75 Earth days (making the <span class="venus-color">Venusian</span> solar day shorter than 
                        Mercury's 176 Earth days).[11] One <span class="venus-color">Venusian</span> year is about 1.92 <span class="venus-color">Venusian</span> solar days.
                        
                        [126] To 
                        an observer on the surface of <span class="venus-color">Venus</span>, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east,
                        although <span class="venus-color">Venus</span>' opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.

                        <span class="pl-3"><span class="venus-color bold">Venus</span></span> may have formed from the solar nebula with a different rotation period and 
                        obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by 
                        planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that 
                        would have occurred over the course of billions of years. The rotation period of 
                        <span class="venus-color">Venus</span> may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, 
                        which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick 
                        <span class="venus-color">Venusian</span> atmosphere.[128][129] The 584-day average interval between successive close

                        [130] but the hypothesis of a spin-orbit resonance with Earth has been discounted.
