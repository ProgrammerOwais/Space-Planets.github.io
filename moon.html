            The  <strong>Moon</strong> is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter 
            the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia),[15] 
            it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative 
            to the size of its planet,[f] the fifth largest satellite in the 
            Solar System overall, and is larger than any dwarf planet. Orbiting 
            Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi),[16] or about 
            <span class="bold underline italic">30 times</span> Earth's diameter, its gravitational influence slightly lengthens 
            Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides. The Moon is classified 
            as a planetary-mass object and a differentiated rocky body, and lacks any 
            significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. <span class="italic underline">
            Its surface gravity  is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g);
            </span> Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite 
            in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.

           <div class="para1 bgimg2 mt-2 mt-md-5">
                The Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching, 
                with its long axis displaced 30° from facing the Earth, due to gravitational 
                anomalies from impact basins. Its shape is more elongated than current tidal 
                forces can account for. This 'fossil bulge' indicates that the Moon solidified 
                when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth, and that it is now 
                too cold for its shape to adjust to its orbit.

                            Isotope dating of lunar samples suggests the Moon formed around 
                            50 million years after the origin of the Solar System. 
                            Historically, several formation mechanisms have been proposed
                            but none satisfactorily explained the features of the Earth–Moon system. 
                            A fission of the Moon from Earth's crust  force 
                            would require too great an initial rotation rate of Earth. None of these hypotheses can account 
                             for the high angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system.

                            impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows 
                            that fill those basins.[108][109] The anomalies greatly influence

                            currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal 
                            magnetization likely acquired early in its history when a dynamo was 
                            still operating.[66][67] However, early in its history, 4 billion years ago, 
                            its magnetic field strength was likely close to that of Earth today.[65] This 
                            early dynamo field apparently expired by about one billion years ago, after the 
                            lunar core had completely crystallized.

                            orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex 
                            and interacting ways. For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually 
                            rotates once every 18.61 years

                            It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its

                            at 1/9 Pluto's mass.[j][152] The Earth and the Moon's barycentre, their
